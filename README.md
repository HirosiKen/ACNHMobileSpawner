# ACNHMobileSpawner

Item injector for Animal Crossing: New Horizons for mobile built in Unity. 
Requires a Switch running [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) with the plugin [sys-botbase](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase) installed.

Based Heavily on [NHSE](https://github.com/kwsch/NHSE).

### Notes

Some code was deleted and had to be rebuilt using ILSpy. I've done my best to clean up the classes affected, but they will be uncommented, minus ILSpy warnings I've kept in just to know what was affected.
